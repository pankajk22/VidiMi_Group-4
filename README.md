# VidiMi_Group-4

VidiMi Inc. is a (fictitious) organization who makes video mining software. The product managers at VidiMi have identified a new opportunity for creating software products for addressing the following problems:
1. Identifying individuals in a digital photograph.
2. Identifying the movement and presence of individuals from live video streams or video files.
3. Triggering custom workflows on successful detection of the above events (i.e., individuals getting spotted in a photo or video).

Some of the application areas for the products that address the above problems could be:
1. Face recognition based attendance systems
2. Surveillance video scanning for law enforcement agencies
3. Industrial applications for worker hazard avoidance

You need to build the necessary documentation, specifications and software for addressing the above business opportunity.

In this assignment, you are expected to develop the detailed SRS for the above software. You should identify the relevant stakeholders, and interact with them and other sources for eliciting the requirements for the envisioned products.
